# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with PyTorch: MLP on MNIST

This repository provides a hands-on tutorial for building a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture in PyTorch. The notebook, **GANs on MNIST with MLP**, explores the basics of GANs and demonstrates how to train a model to generate handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Contents

- **GAN Architecture**: Understand the generator and discriminator models in a GAN and their interplay during training.
- **MNIST Dataset**: Utilize the MNIST dataset for generating realistic handwritten digit images.
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Step-by-step implementation using PyTorch, including data loading, model architecture, and training loops.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
